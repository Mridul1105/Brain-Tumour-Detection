# Brain-Tumour-Detection
The early detection of brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes. This project proposes an advanced approach for brain tumor detection using the U-Net architecture. U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image segmentation tasks, is utilized for segmenting the brain tumor regions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. U-Net, a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for image segmentation tasks, is utilized for segmenting the brain tumor regions from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The model is trained on a publicly available dataset of brain MRI images, achieving high accuracy in tumor segmentation and detection. This approach aims to enhance the speed, accuracy, and reliability of brain tumor detection, contributing to the advancement of medical imaging technologies and improving clinical decision-making in neurology.
